# Firmware dump and disassembly

This directory contain the firmware dump of the later rubber dome keyboard. I diassembled the code usinga a 8048 disassembler and manually annotated the code just to gett
an understanding what it is doing. For the send receive routines that I intended to mimic in close detail I reverseengineered the assembly into C-code.

The disasembly is just for refernce only. Not to be used for assembling a working program. I have moved code section to make the analysis task easier.
